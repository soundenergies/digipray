A digital prayer wheel developed by the help of ChatGPT, inspired by Intention Repeater

The program repeats a mantra (string) of your choice in computer memory. It determines the maximum repetition rate per second based on available memory. It also verifies that the string is not compressed before reaching the PC memory. If compression is detected, a warning message appears. A custom repetition rate can be chosen or the estimated maximum. The intent of the software is to implement a digital prayer wheel according to modern principles of technology, as Dalai Lama had allegedly said a hard drive that spins the mantra is effective (but HDDs are rarely used anymore). It is not so different from wind- and water-powered prayer wheels. So, this can be useful to Buddhists to let the computer pray for you automatically. I use the mantra OM MANI PADME HUM. It is written in Python.
